class StorageInterfaceDirVar(object):
    """
    Storage Interface Directory/Variable (SIDV) class is a versatile, dynamic class which gives structure to the
    variables stored on disk by representing them as methods of the StorageInterface and other instances of itself.
    New variables and folders are created by simply trying to use them as properties of the class itself.
    The data stored and read is not kept in memory, the SIDV passes the data onto the writer or tells the fetcher to
    read from disk on demand.

    The API only shows the protected and internal methods of the SIDV class which cannot be used for variable and
    directory names.

    This class is never meant to be used as its own object and should never be invoked by itself. The class is currently
    housed outside of the main StorageInterface class to show the API to users.

    TODO: Move this class as an internal class of StorageInterface (NOT a subclass)

    == Examples ==

    Create a basic storage system and write new DATA to disk
    >>> my_storage = StorageInterface('my_store.nc')
    >>> my_storage.my_variable.write(DATA)

    Create a folder called "vardir" with two variables in it, "var1" and "var2" holding DATA1 and DATA2 respectively
    >>> my_storage = StorageInterface('my_store.nc')
    >>> my_storage.vardir.var1.write(DATA1)
    >>> my_storage.vardir.var2.write(DATA2)

    Fetch data from the same folders and variables as above
    >>> my_storage = StorageInterface('my_store.nc')
    >>> var1 = my_storage.vardir.var1.fetch()
    >>> var2 = my_storage.vardir.var2.fetch()

    Run some_function() to generate data over an iteration, store each value in a dynamically sized var called "looper"
    >>> my_storage = StorageInterface('my_store.nc')
    >>> for i in range(10):
    >>>     mydata = some_function()
    >>>     my_storage.looper.append(mydata)

    """
    USER FUNCTIONS
    Methods the user calls on SIDV variables to actually store and read data from disk. These cannot be names of child
    SIDV instances and will raise an error if you try to use them as such.
    """

    def write(self, data, protected_write=True):
        """
        Write data to a variable which cannot be appended to, nor overwritten (unless specified). This method should
        be called when you do not want the value stored to change, typically written only once. The protected_write
        variable will let you overwrite this behavior if you want to use something on disk that is a toggleable flag,
        but does not change in shape.

        Metadata is added to this variable if possible to indicate this is a write protectable variable.

        This method raises an error if this instance of SIDV is DIRECTORY

        Parameters
        ----------
        data
            This is what will be written to disk, the data will be processed by the STORAGESYSTEM as to how to actually
            handle the data once the units have been stripped out and assigned to this instance of SIDV.
        protected_write : boolean, default True
            Decide whether to check if the variable is already on file if present.
            If True, no overwrite is allowed and an error is raised if the variable already exists.
            If False, overwriting is allowed but the variable will still not be able to be appended to.

        """

    def append(self, data):
        """
        Write data to a variable who's size changes every time this function is called. The first dimension of the
        variable on disk will be appended with data after checking the size. If no variable exists, one is created with
        a dynamic variable size for its first dimension, then the other dimensions are inferred from the data.

        This method raises an error if this instance of SIDV is DIRECTORY

        Parameters
        ----------
        data
            This is what will be written to disk, the data will be processed by the STORAGESYSTEM as to how to actually
            handle the data once the units have been stripped out and assigned to this instance of SIDV.

    def fetch(self):
        """
        Read the variable and its data from disk.

        If this instance is unbound to an object in the storage_handler or is DIRECTORY, then this method raises an
        error.

        Returns
        -------
        data
            Data stored on VARIABLE read from disk and processed through the STORAGESYSTEM back into a Python type
            and possibly through the UNIT logic to recast into Quantity before being handed to the user.
        """

    def add_metadata(self, name, data):
        """
        Attempt to add metadata to the variable/directory. Usually a string input to include additional information
        about the variable.

        Because this can act on DIRECTORY or VARIABLE types, all metadata is buffered until this instance of SIDV is
        bound to an object on the file itself.

        This does not check if the metadata already exists and simply overwrites it if present.


        Parameters
        ----------
        name : string
            Name of the metadata variable. Since this is data we are directly attaching to the variable or directory
            itself, we do not make this another SIDV instance.
        data: What data you wish to attach to the `name`d metadata pointer.
