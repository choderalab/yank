class Topography(object):
    """A class mapping and labelling the different components of a system.

    The object holds the topology of a system and offers convenience functions
    to identify its various parts such as solvent, receptor, ions and ligand
    atoms.

    A molecule should be labeled as a ligand, only if there is also a receptor.
    If there is only a single molecule its atom indices can be obtained from
    solute_atoms instead. In ligand-receptor system, solute_atoms provides the
    atom indices for both molecules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    topology : mdtraj.Topology or simtk.openmm.app.Topology
        The topology object specifying the system.
    ligand_atoms : iterable of int or str, optional
        The atom indices of the ligand. A string is interpreted as an mdtraj
        DSL specification of the ligand atoms.
    solvent_atoms : iterable of int or str, optional
        The atom indices of the solvent. A string is interpreted as an mdtraj
        DSL specification of the solvent atoms. If 'auto', a list of common
        solvent residue names will be used to automatically detect solvent
        atoms (default is 'auto').

        Select atoms based on selection format which can be a number of formats:

        * Single integer (a bit redundant)
        * Iterable of integer (also a bit redundant)
        * Complex Region selection
        * MDTraj String
        * SMARTS Selection

        This method will never return duplicate atom numbers.

        The ``sort_by`` method controls how the output is sorted before being returned, see the details in the
        Parameters block for information about each option

        The Complex Region string returns an the set of atoms derived from the arguments using logical operators
        ``and`` and ``or``
        along with grouping through parenthesis . For example, assume you
        have two regions ``regionA = [0,1,2,3]`` and ``regionB = [2,3,4,5]``. You can do operations such as the
        following:

             ``regionA and regionB`` yields ``[2,3]``, which is the intersection of the regions.

             ``regionA or regionB`` yields ``[0,1,2,3,4,5]``, which is the union of the regions.

        More complex statements with more regions will also work, and statements can be grouped with ``()``.

        The ``subset`` keyword filters the ``selection`` relative to this subset selection. If not None, the subset is
        processed first through this same function, then the primary selection is processed relative to it.
        ``subset`` follows the same conditions as ``selection``, but sort order for subset is ignored
        If your ``selection`` would pick atoms that are NOT part of the subset, then those atoms are NOT RETURNED.
        If your ``selection`` is an integer or some sequence of integer, then the indices are relative to the
        ``subset``.
        Final atom numbers will be absolute to the whole Topography.

        Parameters
        ----------
        selection : str, list of ints, or int
            String defining the selection
        as_set : bool, Default False
            Determines output format. Returns a Set if True, otherwise output is a list.
        sort_by : str or None, Default: 'auto'
            Determine how to sort the output if ``as_set`` is False.

            * 'auto': Let the selection string determine how to sort it out based on its priorities
            * 'index': Atoms are sorted index, smallest to largest
            * 'region_order': Atoms are sorted by which region in the provided ``selection_string`` occurs first.
                So if your expression is ``region1 and region2``, then the output will be atoms which appear in
                ``region1`` first. Parenthesis are **ignored** so the expression ``region1 and (region2 or region3)``
                will prioritize ``region1`` first for sorting. This option only works for expressions on Regions,
                other selections will fall back to ``None``
            * ``None``: Sorting is left up to however the selection string is processed by their respective drivers,
                or by whatever order the set operations returns it. Not guaranteed to be deterministic in all cases.

        subset : None, str, list of ints, or int; Optional; Default: None
            Set of atoms to make a relative selection to. Follows the same rules as ``selection`` for valid inputs.
            If None, ``selection`` is on whole Topography.


        Returns
        -------
        selection : list or set
            Returns the selected atoms as either a list or set based on ``as_set`` keyword.
            Order of the output is determined by the ``sort_by`` keyword. If a ``as_set`` is ``True``, this option has
            no effect.
