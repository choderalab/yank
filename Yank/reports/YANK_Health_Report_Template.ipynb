We simply look at some property $A_t = A(x_t)$ over the course of the simulation---ideally, a property that we know has some slow behavior that may affect the quantities we are interested in computing ($A(x)$ is a good choice if we're interested in the expectation $<A>$) and find the point where $A_t$ seems to have \"settled in\" to typical equilibrium behavior.\n",

This has the advantage of ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting transition matrix among alchemical states are purely real.\n",

    "In practice, it's a great idea to monitor these statistics as the simulation is running, even if no data is discarded to equilibration at that point.
