# An uncommon recipe
options:
  resume_setup: yes  # Because we are using some common repository of molecules/systems
  resume_experiment: no  # Do NOT try to use any existing experiment folder (not recommended)
  output_dir: /data/mygroup/me/yank_simulations/kinase_sims
  # Absolute path, no relativity
  setup_dir: /data/mygroup/me/yank_simulations/molecule_repository  # This assumes some common setup (very uncommon)
  # Relative to the output_dir
  experiments_dir: experiments  # This is the default so setting this with "experiments" is the same as omitting this key
