This section lists features and improvements of note in each release.

The full release history can be viewed `at the GitHub yank releases page <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/releases>`_.


0.25.3 - Development
--------------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added support for CHARMM-format inputs in arbitrary phase free energies setup by user using ``phase1_path`` and ``phase2_path`` keywords (`#1207 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1207>`_).

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- Fixed a bug that causes solute-only trajectories to be extracted with an incorrect order when the ions appear before
the solute atoms in the system (`#1213 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1213>`_).
- A few fixes to the documentation (`#1213 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1213>`_).
- Updated yaml loader to use FullLoader (related to `#1152 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/1152>`)


0.25.2 - Bugfix release
-----------------------

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- Fixed a bug that causes YANK to crash in when thermodynamic trailblazing is interrupted and then resumed with the
option ``bidirectional_redistribution`` set. (`#1195 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1195>`_).


0.25.1 - Bugfix and more robust yank status command
---------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- The command ``yank status`` now handles gracefully the case where it attempts to open a locked netcdf file (`#855 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/855>`_).
- Fix bug causing YANK to crash sometimes when the option ``bidirectional_redistribution`` was activated (`#1192 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1192>`_).


0.25.0 - Moved multistate and mpi modules and new trailblaze algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------------------

API-breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The ``yank.mpi`` module and the objects in the ``yank.multistate`` package, which were deprecated in 0.24.0, have now
  been removed, and they can be found in the ``mpiplus`` and ``openmmtools`` libraries respectively.
- The function ``yank.pipeline.trailblaze_alchemical_protocol`` has been renamed
  ``yank.pipeline.run_thermodynamic_trailblazing`` (`#1180 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1180>`_).

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The thermodynamic trailblazing algorithm used for the authomatic generation of the alchemical path is now capable of
  resuming after an unexpected interruption or crash. The samples generated during the process are used to initialize
  the replicas of the replica exchange or SAMS free energy calculation. This behavior can be controlled through the
  ``start_from_trailblaze_samples`` YAML `option <http://getyank.org/latest/yamlpages/options.html#start-from-trailblaze-samples>`_ (`#1176 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1176>`_, `#1180 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1180>`_).
- It is possible to control more options of the thermodynamic trailblazing algorithm and to discretize an alchemical
  path given through mathematical expressions enslaved to a generic variable (`#1180 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1180>`_).
- Added a ``--setup-only`` flag in the ``yank script`` CLI command to run the automatic setup pipeline without running
  the free energy calculation (`#1178 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1178>`_).

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- Fix a bug in which a list of ``experiments: [exp1, exp2]`` in the YAML file containing an unnkown experiment name would
  fail silently without error (`#1178 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1178>`_).
- Fixed a problem that would prevent YANK to work with Cerberus >= 1.2 (`#1180 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1180>`_).
- Fixed the error message displayed when the anisotropic dispersion correction cutoff was too big for the box dimension
  (`#1181 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1181>`_).

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- By default, the automatic determination of the alchemical path now starts with the harmonic/flat-bottom restraint
  turned off and activate it in intermediate states instead of keeping the restraint activated throughout the calculation
  and reweighting in the analysis stage (`#1176 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1176>`_).

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Using parallel MPI processes causes poor mixing of the odd thermodynamic states while the mixing of the even states is
  normal. We're still investigating whether the issue is caused by a change in the MPI library or an internal bug. For
  now, we recommend running calculations using only 1 GPU (see also `openmmtools#449 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/449>`_
  and `#1130 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/1130>`_).
- Simulations restored from a checkpoint file have their velocities reset to zero (`#1115 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/1115>`_).
- Forward and backward convergence analysis free energy traces in the Jupter notebook are incorrect (`#971 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/971>`_).
- Setup will fail if .mol2 atom substructure ID matches filename (`#703 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/703>`_).


0.24.1 Bugfix release
---------------------

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
- Fixed import of ``logsumexp()`` which was moved from ``scipy.misc`` to ``scipy.special`` (`#1162 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1162>`_).
- Fixed a bug in which validation of molecules and system file paths did not consider paths relative to the YAML script path (`#1164 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1164>`_).
- Improve the robustness of opening the netcdf file on resuming of the multi-state samplers by setting the environment variable ``HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING`` to ``'FALSE'`` after 4 failed attempts (`#1168 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1168>`_).
- Fixed a bug causing a crash during exception handling (`#1168 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1168>`_).
- Fixed a bug causing a crash in selftest.py when loading OpenEye (`#1170 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1170>`_).

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The class ``yank.utils.TLeap`` can now create octahedral boxes. This is not exposed in the YAML script yet, however (`#1160 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1160>`_).


0.24.0 Experimental support for online status files
---------------------------------------------------

- Added an experimental feature that allows ``--status`` to be provided with ``yank script`` invocations to emit a ``status.pkl`` file in the experiment directory at the conclusion of each experiment switch interval (`#1135 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1135>`_). This feature is experimental, and its invocation may be changed in a future release.
- This release requires OpenMMTools >= 0.17.0, which includes a much faster way of implementing exact treatment of PME during alchemical calculations (`#1136 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1136>`_).
- Some NetCDF robustness improvements
- SAMS improvements
  * SAMS now properly restores `t0` and `stage`, which should correctly persist the stage across phase switches and resumes
  * Added SAMS `logZ_history` plot to notebook reports
  * SAMS `self._stage` is now an integer to more easily store this in storage (0 is initial, 1 is asymptotic phase)
  * Suppress some verbose outputs
  * If an asymptotically optimal stage is present in a SAMS simulation, the initial stage is discarded to equilibration and automatic equilibration detection is applied to the asymptotically optimal weight adjustment region only.
  * Jupyter notebook reports now show SAMS weight convergence if present
- The ``yank.multistate`` package was deprecated. In the future, this package will be available in OpenMMTools (`#1146 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1146>`_).

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The use of more than one process per experiment via MPI has known issues that are being debugged (`#1130 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/1130>`_).
- Simulations restored from a checkpoint file have their velocities reset to zero (`#1115 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/1115>`_).
- Forward and backward convergence analysis free energy traces in the Jupter notebook are incorrect (`#971 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/971>`_).
- Peptide ligands are not currently supported (`#376 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/376>`_).
- Setup will fail if .mol2 atom substructure ID matches filename (`#703 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/issues/703>`_).

0.23.7 Bugfix release

0.23.6 Bugfix release
---------------------

- Fix bug where redefining ``MCDisplacement/RotationMove`` in the YAML ``mcmc_moves`` block without specifying ``atom_subset`` caused the MC move to affect the whole system instead of only the ligand atoms (`#1099 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1099>`_).
- Add ``net_charge`` option to the antechamber YAML pipeline for charged small molecules  (`#1099 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1099>`_).
- Added YAML syntax tutorial in the online documentation  (`#1099 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1099>`_).

0.23.5 Bugfix release
---------------------

- Fix bug where the stack trace of an exception raised by an MPI process would be logged incorrectly (`#1084 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1084>`_).
- Improved robustness of NetCDF dataset opening and closing (`#1084 <https://github.com/choderalab/yank/pull/1084>`_).

0.23.3 Adds support for single mutations using Modeller
-------------------------------------------------------
- Adds an optional ``modeller` directive to the ``molecules`` section of the YAML file
  through `Modeller <https://salilab.org/modeller/>`_, a tool for comparative modeling of protein structures.

0.21.0 SAMS and General Multistate Samplers
-------------------------------------------

This release represents a major change in the YANK codebase.

Summary of Release
""""""""""""""""""
YANK's sampling scheme now has a generalized scheme and runs on one of three primary samplers:

- ``MultiStateSampler``: Fixed state sampler where no states mix
- ``ReplicaExchange``: Dense state sampling with state swapping each iteration
- ``ParallelTempering``: Special extension of ``ReplicaExchange`` which swaps temperatures, with more efficient energy evaluation
- ``SAMSSampler``: Self-Adjusted Mixture Sampling :cite:`Tan2017:SAMS`, Single replica sampler which dynamically samples all thermodynamic states with long enough run time

The samplers are now part of the YANK ``multistate`` module and will eventually be ported to ``OpenMMTools``. The
YAML syntax has been extended that two new sections can be specified: :doc:`MCMC Moves <yamlpages/mcmc>`, and
:doc:`Samplers <yamlpages/samplers>`. These are fully optional blocks which default to a specific set if not specified.
Several old YAML options like ``number_of_iterations`` have been moved to the ``samplers`` block and replaced with
``default_X`` where ``X`` is the old setting name.

The old scheme of the single ``repex.py`` file housing all sampler and reporter information has been removed and the
entire ``multistate`` module is designed to be extended and experimented with. Similarly, much of the old
``analyze.py`` module has been migrated to ``multistate`` and can be extended as well.

Detailed Changes
""""""""""""""""

- Generalize the Sampler framework into a new ``multistate`` module and generalized sampler class structure
- Analysis suite now general and part of ``multistate`` with additional YANK-specific extensions in YANK's ``analyze.py`` module
